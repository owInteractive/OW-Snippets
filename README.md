## Editor Config

We use editorconfig as default, its settings must be above the configuration of your text editor or IDE

If you use VSCODE as 99% of OW programmers, you download the extension [here](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vscode)

To download go to the project root and run

```
curl -o .editorconfig https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owinteractive/ow-editor-config/master/.editorconfig
```
